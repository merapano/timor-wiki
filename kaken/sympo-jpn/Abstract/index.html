<p>Between <em>Rai na'in</em> and <em>Rai Timor</em>: Nationalism
and Belonging at scale in Timor Leste.</p>

<h1>Abstract (300characters)</h1>

<p>Historically the diverse ethno-linguistic
communities of Timor-Leste have defined
themselves through local resource
jurisdictions of belonging (<em>Rai na'in</em>). But
the independence struggle forged novel,
imaginative connections to the idea of a
national homeland (<em>Rai Timor</em>). This paper
examines the relationship and latent tension
between these two encompassing ontologies.</p>

<h1>Abstract (250 words)</h1>

<p>Historically the diverse ethno-linguistic
communities of Timor-Leste have long defined
themselves through local ancestral resource
jurisdictions and mythic histories of
settlement, exchange and alliance. Central to
this conception of place and belonging is the
idea of the <em>Rai na'in</em>, a Tetum language term
with local language variants that refer to
‘custodians of the land'. The brutal,
generation long struggle for independence
however, promoted new forms of imaginative
connection and belonging encapsulated in the
concept of <em>Rai Timor</em> or homeland. The notion
of  <em>Rai Timor</em> is not merely a more
encompassing ‘homeland' than the landed
inheritance of locally embedded communities,
but it is imagined in a different way, as a
territory shaped from below and collectively,
by the ordeals of ‘the people', who become
the active originators of the nation
[Traube 2007] . If the constitutive act of a
subject in the traditional ideology of rule
is to recognise and defer to authority vested
in ritual and political leaders (the <em>rai
na'in</em>), the constitutive act of belonging to
the nation is to suffer and sacrifice for it
(the <em>Rai Timor</em>)
[McWilliam and Traube 2011]. This
presentation considers the contemporary force
of this expansive sense of the imagined
community in Timor-Leste -  a notion that
Anderson also described as ‘aggregated
nativeness'(2003) - in the light of the well
documented resurgence of custom (kultura) and
traditional authority.  How do these
different scales of allegiance and belonging
contribute to the shaping of contemporary
society in post-independence Timor-Leste? I
discuss these and other questions with
reference to the Fataluku ethnography.</p>
