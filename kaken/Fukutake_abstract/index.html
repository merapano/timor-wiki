<h1>Wars and Migrations in Southern Tetum Society, Timor Island</h1>

<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>This paper demonstrates the importance of the kingdom of Wehali for
the Timorese, especially those who lived in the western part of
Timor-Leste, during past wars. People who lived in the western part
of Timor-Leste such as Cova Lima, Bobonaro, and Ermera have fled to
the villages of their relatives in Belu, West Timor. For outsiders,
this evacuation seems to be the act of ‘refugees’ who flee beyond
national borders. However, this meant that people fled to the
‘centre’ of the ancient kingdom, particularly because the elders
had transferred the luliks, or ancestral objects, there. Luliks are
passed down from one generation to the next and can be in the form
of various objects, such as local antique textiles called tais,
ceramics obtained from Chinese merchants, and even the Holy Cross
and Bible given by Catholic missionaries.</p>

<p>Focusing on the movement of people and luliks during the past
wars, I have pointed out that the centre of the ancient kingdom
continues to be important, particularly for people who live in the
western part of the new nation state, and that there exists a
cultural identity beyond the national border in central Timor.</p>
