<h1>概観</h1>

まるうつし：</p>

<blockquote><p>This is a small sect with animist beliefs that is
estimated to have a few hundred supporters and
whose members claim to reject the authority of the
government. [12/13]</p>

<p>The group’s followers believe fallen independence
fighters will come alive again and return from the
forests to lead them. The followers are poor,
illiterate peasants from rural areas and some
ex-guerrillas. According to an anthropologist
Mathew Libbis doing field work in the Manufahi
area, Colimau has strong local support in its
power base around the Kemak suco of Leimea Kraik
in Hatolia.</p>

<p>Colimau 2000 returned from West Timor in 2000, and
despite claims of animism, they apparently invited
a priest to consec rate the ground on which a
church was to be built. According to Mathew
Libbis, Colimau is a Kemak expression meaning to
hate each other, but according to the 2001 Suco
Survey, it is also the name of a Bunak suco in
Bobonaro.</p>

<p>Colimau was one of the clandestine groups th at
fought for East Timor's independence from
Indonesia for decades. After it voted to break
away from the CNRT in August 1999, Colimau 2000
members were not accommod ated in government
offices or the legislature. The group was also
involved in a controversy in 2003 when the defense
forces arrested their members in large num bers,
without following due process. This has further
fuelled group’s sense of grievance.</p>

<p>Led by Osorio Mau Leke and Bruno da Costa
Magalhaes, Colimau 2000 have gone through a series
of name changes, currently re-inventing themselves
as the Movement for National Unity (MUN), perhaps
in an attempt to gain a wider base of support. The
main demand of the MUN is th at the national flag
be changed as it should not be the flag of
Fretilin, a political party.</p>

<p>Due to its proximity to the border, the group is
believed to have some following in the refugee
camps in Indonesia. There have also been
allegations about the group having made contact
with militia leaders in West Timor in order to
plan a strategy to destabilize the country after
the UN peacekeepers leave; at least one source of
this accusation is the Indonesian military comma
nder in West Timor. Accusations have been made
that the group has been in volved in petty crime
and extortion.</p>

<p>Colimau 2000 is widely feared and believed to be
involved in a number of violent incidents in the
current crisis , most recently on August 14 when
they clashed with a martial arts group in
Bobonaro, leaving one person seriously injured.
Other sources maintain that this group’s fearsome
reputa tion is undeserved, that they get blamed
for incidents they were not involved in . As
described earlier, this group was disciplined and
peaceful during the violence of early September in
Caicoli, Dili, following the arrest of Major
