<h1>Gold</h1>

<p>ピガフェッタの『航海記』
[@pigafetta-voyage]によれば、
<a href="../Cabanaza/">Cabanaza</a> では金が取れるという。</p>

<p>[@wittouck-timor]  p.348 によれば
Manufai に金があるのは周知の事実だという。
これは <a href="../Manufahi/">Manufahi</a> かしらん。</p>

<p>p. 349 に金の採掘の様子の詳細な記述がある。</p>

<blockquote><p>Placer mining has been carried on in a
desultory fashion in the southern part of
the district by natives. The Timorese
method of washing gold is probably the most
primitive in the world. It is done by
placing in a ditch a piece of sandstone
half an inch to 22 inches thick, 6 to 10
inches long, and 4 to 6 inches wide. A
stream of water about '2 inch deep is
allowed to flow through the ditch and over
the stone, which is placed so that it
slopes slightly downstream. Gold-bearing
gravels are dug out of the bank, coconut
shells being used for scoops, and are then
gathered in wooden pans; the gravel is
poured slowly over the washing stone, the
material mixing with the stream of
water. Gold is then picked from the
sandstone and put in quills. The amount of
gravel that can be handled by this method
is naturally very small. As the water-level
in the gravels is usually high, the natives
rarely get near bed-rock.  All the gold
particles appear to be rough, and flour
gold is not usually found; the largest
nugget observed in the district weighed 107
grammes, and quite a number weighing io
grammes and more were panned in I936. The
rivers reported to have produced the most
are the Sue river, the south Laclo, and the
Cler.</p></blockquote>
