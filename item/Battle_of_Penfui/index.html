<h1>ペンフイの戦い</h1>

<p>[[!tag  _Hist-Port]]</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="../Gaspar_da_Costa/">Gaspar da Costa</a>'s relations with the Dutch
colonizers in Kupang in westernmost Timor were
generally poor. In 1735 a Topass army seriously
threatened Kupang, and in 1746-49 the Topasses
intervened on the Island of Roti, a Dutch
dependency close to Timor. In 1748 a number of
Timorese princedoms in West Timor, who were
usually clients to the Portuguese, turned
rebellious against <a href="../Gaspar_da_Costa/">Gaspar da Costa</a>. As the
Topass forces fought back, lots of Timorese
refugees headed for Kupang and the Dutch, who
sympathized with the rebels. Especially, the
ruler of the prestigious <a href="../Sonbai/">Sonbai</a> princedom joined
the Dutch with the bulk of his followers. Gaspar
da Costa raised a comprehensive army consisting
of Topasses and levies from the various Timorese
princedoms still under his control. The Dutch
calculated it to be 20,000 men or even more. The
professed aim of Gaspar da Costa was to bring
the fugitives back and to eliminate the Dutch
garrison in Kupang. The Topass-Timorese army
camped at Penfui, at present-day El Tari Airport
east of Kupang, where they made fortifications
of stone and earth. On 9 November 1749 the Dutch
sent out a multi-ethnic force consisting of
Europeans, Solorese, Sawunese, Rotinese,
mardijkers (non-whites in Dutch service),
Timorese, etc. In the ensuing Battle of Penfui
they attacked the fortifications of Gaspar da
Costa with success. The weakness of his large
but non-uniform army became apparent as big
contingents fled the field in the beginning of
the battle. When Gaspar da Costa attempted to
leave the battlefield on horseback he was
pierced by a Timorese spear, while his followers
were slaughtered in the thousands.[3] The Topass
defeat meant that the Dutch were able to extend
their sphere of influence to most of West Timor
during the following decade. In this way the
battle laid the ground for the colonial division
of Timor in two halves, which was permanented in
the nineteenth century, with consequences until
today.</p></blockquote>
