                   examine the historical background to developments in

                   initial reconstruction stage in the country's
                   transition to independence. The volume is divided
                   into three thematic sections - background, assessment
                   and reconstruction - bringing together the
                   experiences and knowledge of academic researchers and
                   key participants in the extraordinary events of 1999
                   and 2000. // After years of Indonesian rule, the
                   people of East Timor voted to reject an offer of
                   autonomy choosing instead independence from
                   Indonesia. This decision enraged pro-integrationist
                   militia who, backed by the Indonesian military,
                   launched a program of violence and destruction
                   against the inhabitants of East Timor. President
                   Habibie eventually agreed to the presence of a United
                   Nations peace-keeping force, but by this stage East
                   Timor had been ravaged by destruction. // The new
                   East Timorese government faced the challenges of the
                   future with an understanding that the successful
                   struggle for independence was both a culmination and
                   a starting point for the new nation. As the events of
                   1999 recede, many of the issues and challenges
                   highlighted in Out of the Ashes remain of central
                   significance to the future of East Timor. These
                   essays provide essential reading for students and
                   interested observers of the first new nation of the
                   21st century.},

                   Timor, Second Edition},
  year =          {2003},
  abstract =      {In the second edition of this study of religion and
                   kinship in East Timor, David Hicks argues that
                   reproductive rituals and ideas regarding fertility
                   and gender direct the notion that for the
                   Tetum-speaking people of Caraubalo suku, in the
                   district of Viqueque, life and death derive from the
                   same source. This source is the world of the
                   ancestral ghosts (the mate bein). The soul of a
                   person (the klamar mate) who has died becomes
                   transformed by ritual action into an agency for
                   life-affirming fertility, that is, an ancestral
                   ghost, and it is from the ancestors that fertility,
                   which sustains life down the generations, originates.
                   Incorporated into this complex of ideas regarding
                   life, fertility, gender, and death, are two
                   recreational institutions, cockfighting and
                   kick-fighting, which Dr. Hicks argues are ritualized
                   manifestations of fertility and infertility
                   respectively, as well as gendered aspects of the
                   sacred (lulik) and secular (sau) worlds. In addition
                   to contributing to the comparative study of ritual
                   and indigenous notions of reproduction, the second
                   edition of Tetum Ghosts and Kin: Fertility and Gender
                   in East Timor provides an ethnographic portrait of
                   village life among a people whose traditions were
                   about to be abruptly devastated by war and conquest.
                   In a summary retrospect he outlines the events that
                   overtook the East Timorese between the time of his
                   first period of fieldwork and East Timor's becoming a
                   nation on May 20, 2002, and concludes with a brief
                   description of the present condition of Caraubalo.},

  abstract =      {This thesis examines the local reception of
                   international state-building in post-1999 East Timor.
                   Contemporary literature on state-building and
                   peace-building has largely concentrated on the
                   structure of state institutions and activities by
                   international actors and local elites. Drawing upon
                   various sources of data including field research and
                   historical and anthropological literature, this
                   thesis explores Timorese society's relationship with
                   the modern state, which was built under international
                   and national auspices. It demonstrates the
                   significant impact of local culture of governance on
                   the local reception of state institutions, and
                   elucidates a variety of factors that uphold the
                   culture of governance. In order to grapple with the
                   malleable and ever-contested nature of local culture,
                   this thesis analyses state-building as an interactive
                   process between state and society and involving a
                   number of actors, thereby forming and reforming the
                   local culture of governance. The local culture of
                   governance was heavily influenced by the nation's
                   colonial past. Democratic state institution-building
                   reflected post-colonial characteristics of political
                   culture; electoral democracy was continuously
                   projected with, and redefined through, the sense of
                   nation-ness, which had a strong emphasis on unity
                   over diversity. Like many other post-conflict
                   societies, large parts of East Timor had maintained
                   viable customary forms of governance based on a
                   kinship community. Village institutions built in the
                   post-1999 period therefore became an intersection
                   where the 'universal' ideas of governance, such as
                   democracy and gender equality, met 'traditional'
                   norms of governance. The local subsistence
                   agriculture-based economy was also a key component in
                   the resilient local 'traditional' culture. State
                   judicial institutions were not particularly active in
                   rural areas due to conceptual gaps and lack of
                   infrastructural backing. Crucially, the significant
                   presence of the international community and the
                   introduction of the neo-liberal market economy in
                   post-1999 East Timor also brought about rapid change
                   in the culture of governance, influencing the local
                   society's relationship with state institutions. In
                   short, informed by the history of colonialism and
                   embedded in socio-economic structures, the local
                   culture of governance had significant implications
                   for the way in which local society engaged with the
                   state. Such findings encourage scholars to reconsider
                   the idea that a particular set of state institutions
                   inevitably brings about stability and peace in
                   conflict-torn societies.},

                   examine the historical background to developments in
                   East Timor and provide political analysis on the
                   initial reconstruction stage in the country's
                   transition to independence. The volume is divided
                   into three thematic sections - background, assessment
                   and reconstruction - bringing together the
                   experiences and knowledge of academic researchers and
                   key participants in the extraordinary events of 1999
                   and 2000. // After years of Indonesian rule, the
                   people of East Timor voted to reject an offer of
                   autonomy choosing instead independence from
                   Indonesia. This decision enraged pro-integrationist
                   militia who, backed by the Indonesian military,
                   launched a program of violence and destruction
                   against the inhabitants of East Timor. President
                   Habibie eventually agreed to the presence of a United
                   Nations peace-keeping force, but by this stage East
                   Timor had been ravaged by destruction. // The new
                   East Timorese government faced the challenges of the
                   future with an understanding that the successful
                   struggle for independence was both a culmination and
                   a starting point for the new nation. As the events of
                   1999 recede, many of the issues and challenges
                   highlighted in Out of the Ashes remain of central
                   significance to the future of East Timor. These
                   essays provide essential reading for students and
                   interested observers of the first new nation of the
                   21st century.},

  abstract =      {The events in April 2006 that propelled Timor Leste
                   into an ongoing political and social crisis came as a
                   surprise to most observers. The disintegration of the
                   security forces into multiple factions and the
                   emergence of large, organized street gangs and a
                   diverse range of potentially destabilising
                   disaffected political groups was also largely
                   unpredicted. The sources of the violence are also
                   varied and complex, including long standing ethnic
                   tensions over the control of the markets and trading
                   routes, property disputes arising from post 1999
                   resettlement, rival factions within the security
                   forces, endemic gang rivalries, and a politically
                   driven destabilization campaign by opposition
                   parties. The one common thread is the involvement of
                   large numbers of young, marginalized males. The
                   sources of their alienation are well known through a
                   number of recent studies which revealed a sense of
                   disenfranchisement due to a range of factors
                   including unemployment, security concerns, and lack
                   of access to education. Not all youth have resorted
                   to violence however. The key finding of this report
                   was the existence of hundreds of different bairo

                   Their needs and objectives are generally modest, and

                   following the hiatus of research during 24 years of
                   Indonesian rule (1975-99). // This volume brings
                   together a collection of papers from a diverse field
                   of international scholars exploring the multiple ways
                   that East Timorese communities are making and
                   remaking their connections to land and places of
                   ancestral significance. The work is explicitly
                   comparative and highlights the different ways
                   Timorese language communities negotiate access and
                   transactions in land, disputes and inheritance
                   especially in areas subject to historical
                   displacement and resettlement. Consideration is
                   extended to the role of ritual performance and social
                   alliance for inscribing connection and entitlement.
                   Emerging through analysis is an appreciation of how
                   relations to land, articulated in origin discourses,
                   are implicated in the construction of national
                   culture and differential contributions to the
                   struggle for independence. The volume is informed by
                   a range of Austronesian cultural themes and
                   highlights the continuing vitality of customary
                   governance and landed attachment in Timor-Leste.},

  abstract =      {Few Pacific history books have stood the test of time
                   as well as They Came for Sandalwood. Dorothy
                   Shineberg's book, first published in 1967, has never
                   been bettered. This fascinating account of the
                   sandalwood trade describes the first regular contact
                   between Europeans and the Melanesians of New
                   Caledonia, the Loyalty Islands and the New Hebrides
                   (now Vanuatu). Dr Shineberg studied the relationships
                   and rivalries between European traders and European
                   missionaries, between trader and trader, and between
                   tribe and tribe among the indigenous peoples. Her
                   book documents the details and colour of these
                   interactions. Unseaworthy ships, bloody battles, the
                   hazards of sea and reef, and the firepower and
                   inadequacies of European weapons all provide a
                   gripping picture of the 1830s to 1860s. Valuable
                   appendixes list the ships involved, their cargoes and
                   the location of the sandalwood stations. // They Came
                   for Sandalwood remains the only detailed account of
                   the sandalwood trade, its routes, marketing problems
                   and profits, and of the ships, merchants and seamen
                   involved. It is a sharp, perceptive analysis of the
                   confrontation of the two cultures, approached from
                   the standpoint of Pacific history rather than a mere
                   extension of European history into the Pacific
                   Islands. Professor R. Gerard Ward when reviewing the
                   book for the Journal of Pacific History in 1968 said
                   that it would ``remain of prime importance for
                   historians, anthropologists, geographers and other
                   students of the Pacific for many years.'' His
                   forecast has proved correct. (from UQP web site

  abstract =      {The education system in Timor-Leste today is the
                   culmination of a complex and varied history. There
                   are three distinctive historical periods that have
                   shaped the development of the education system.
                   Firstly, the Portuguese rule from the 1500s through
                   to 1975; then the Indonesian rule from 1975 to 1999;
                   and finally the United Nations administration from
                   1999 to 2002. Timor-Leste's education has been
                   markedly affected by each of these periods. Therefore
                   it is important that the present situation is
                   understood in the context of the 窶湾revious social
                   and economic structures, as this will continue to
                   have an impact on the current situation' (United
                   Nations, 2000, p. 19). Each of the three
                   administrations (Portuguese, Indonesian and the
                   United Nations) introduced its own working process -
                   language, civil service and structure - into the
                   education system. As each administration has also had
                   a definite impact on the society as a whole, the
                   complex issues facing Timor- Leste today are a result
                   of the effects incurred through four hundred years of
                   colonization to independence. This chapter will
                   provide a historical context to the education sector
                   in Timor-Leste.},

                   processes of social recovery and the historic
                   opportunity to pursue field-based ethnography
                   following the hiatus of research during 24 years of
                   Indonesian rule (1975-99). // This volume brings
                   together a collection of papers from a diverse field
                   of international scholars exploring the multiple ways
                   that East Timorese communities are making and
                   remaking their connections to land and places of
                   ancestral significance. The work is explicitly
                   comparative and highlights the different ways
                   Timorese language communities negotiate access and
                   transactions in land, disputes and inheritance
                   especially in areas subject to historical
                   displacement and resettlement. Consideration is
                   extended to the role of ritual performance and social
                   alliance for inscribing connection and entitlement.
                   Emerging through analysis is an appreciation of how
                   relations to land, articulated in origin discourses,
                   are implicated in the construction of national
                   culture and differential contributions to the
                   struggle for independence. The volume is informed by
                   a range of Austronesian cultural themes and
                   highlights the continuing vitality of customary
                   governance and landed attachment in Timor-Leste.},

                   developments since 1975, the structure of employment,
                   and the issues ahead. // The state of education as
                   left by the Portuguese is noted as are the changes
                   brought about by the Indonesian government. There is
                   a comparison of the literacy rate between those
                   people born in East Timor and non-native East
                   Timorese. The lack of tertiary education and its
                   effect upon the population is considered, as is the
                   language debate. Inequalities in employment
                   opportunities are highlighted. The lack of qualified
                   teachers is a concern; few East Timorese are
                   qualified to teach above the primary school level.
                   The lack of job opportunities, generally for the
                   better educated, is frustrating while considerable
                   employment is needed to rebuild the structure of
                   government and infrastructure of the country. // In
                   order for the East Timor economy to grow, the country
                   has to develop strongly in areas such as
                   manufacturing and tourism, both of which will require

                   mechanism for ordering status, at different levels,
                   within specific Austronesian-speaking societies. This
                   is the first volume of its kind to focus entirely on
                   precedence and to provide an explication of its
                   social uses and the way in which it is contested.
                   Each paper is ethnographically-focused and offers its
                   own distinctive approach to the examination of
                   precedence. The papers, however, relate closely to
                   one another and are thus able to proffer a variety of

  abstract =      {Out of the Ashes is a collection of essays that
                   examine the historical background to developments in
                   East Timor and provide political analysis on the
                   initial reconstruction stage in the country's
                   transition to independence. The volume is divided
                   into three thematic sections - background, assessment
                   and reconstruction - bringing together the
                   experiences and knowledge of academic researchers and
                   key participants in the extraordinary events of 1999
                   and 2000. // After years of Indonesian rule, the
                   people of East Timor voted to reject an offer of
                   autonomy choosing instead independence from
                   Indonesia. This decision enraged pro-integrationist
                   militia who, backed by the Indonesian military,
                   launched a program of violence and destruction
                   against the inhabitants of East Timor. President
                   Habibie eventually agreed to the presence of a United
                   Nations peace-keeping force, but by this stage East
                   Timor had been ravaged by destruction. // The new
                   East Timorese government faced the challenges of the
                   future with an understanding that the successful
                   struggle for independence was both a culmination and
                   a starting point for the new nation. As the events of
                   1999 recede, many of the issues and challenges
                   highlighted in Out of the Ashes remain of central
                   significance to the future of East Timor. These
                   essays provide essential reading for students and
                   interested observers of the first new nation of the
                   21st century.},
